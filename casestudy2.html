				<p class="content" id="problemcontent">After discovery was completed, the following problem was unveiled:<br>
				<br>
				(1) travelers want a local perspective and experience but don't know any locals<br>
				(2) meeting strangers in a foreign city is difficult, and can be awkward<br>
				<br>
				From this feedback the problem was identified: travelers need a tool to help connect them with locals, that also bridges the gap of uncomfortability in meeting a stranger.<br>

				<h2 class="subtitle">SOLUTION</h2>
				<p class="content">An application that allows travelers to find local people that advertize activities, so that the traveler can get a local experience, while also reducing social uncomfortability of meeting a new person by setting the expectation of sharing an activity together. This solution offers the user an experience that offers the user a better understand local life, and create a meaningful memory and relationship while traveling.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle ">RESEARCH OVERVIEW</h2>
			<p class="content">First off, I deployed a google forms survey through email, slack, reddit, and a community college student forum in Seattle, WA.<br>
			<br>
			The initial problem hypothesis I was testing for was this: "learning language with a person while sharing an activity produces higher rates of comprehension than classroom learning." Survey responses showed that my hypothesis was confirmed, but the qualitative responses gave me further insight into how the users really felt about the questions at hand. Here is an example of the feedback that changed the scope of the problem, <br><br>“I would want to do one of those activities, but I would never make a lesson plan centered around an activity.  It's boring and tedious to come up with content for practicing language, but if there is an activity/goal involved and no pressure involved, it's easier to interact and I am more motivated to learn the vocabulary and try to speak."<br><br>
			Other feedback about the initial idea yielded the following written responses:<br><br>
			"I don't have enough time to do this regularly"<br><br>
			"Teaching language is boring, I would hang out with someone while learning thought"<br><br>
			"I'd rather just cook together than feel pressured"<br><br>
			"Skipping the language lesson and just hanging out with the person seems better"<br><br>

							John lives in New York and works as an assistant at a video production company, and travels often for work and for pleasure. Earlier this year when traveling in South America John’s spanish improved greatly, so he likes to host Spanish speakers to improve his language.  He’s also a great cook, so he offers to cook for guests at his apartment in NY.

When John travels, he ususally travels alone.  He typically takes long backpacking trips around the world, and he likes to get a feel for local flavor. He’s had many bad experiences with awkward meetups abroad, so he thinks meeting someone for an activity sets good pretense for their visit.  He’s a curious explorer, always ready for his next adventure.

			<p class="content">Three rounds of user testing resulted in three iterations of the dashboard. Since this was my first major project, and my journey on the learning curve is evident. My user experience intuition, skills and eye were evolving along with my prototype as you can see in the changes in the iterations below.<br>

				<p class="content">The first round of user testing was performed in wireframes, and shed a blaring light on the deficiencies of the prototype so far. Here were some of the findings:<br>
				<br>
				(1)The use cases of the plus button and upload button was confusing to users.  Below, you can see the user goals of "create new" "upload" and "go to social media" were split up into three clearly labeled buttons.<br>
				<br>
				(2)Users were unsure about the functions of the menu bar above. Below, you see the menu bar was scrapped, and a dropdown menu was created for each item, to make it apparent you are manipulating that specific document.<br>
				<br>
				(3)Users thought the two separate upload buttons had totally separate functionalities.  In the iteration below, you can see the upload button is now spelled out, and the drag and drop icon was spelled out as well to clarify the functionality to the user.<br>
				<br>
				(4)Users were very unsure how to create new files and organize their content.  In the iteration below, new organizational side navigation panel was created to make it clear to users it was for organizational use.<br>
				<br>
				(5)A major critique of this iteration was the lack of effective use of space. By having this feed bar to the right, users are now able to keep up to date with their feed without switching screens, optimizing efficiency, and promoting constant interactions with all features of FileWeave. I also increased the number of documents on the screen, and decreased the width of the nav to make the dashboard more breathable.</p>

				<div class="one-half column category"><img class="flow-image" src="images/fileweave/usertest3.png" alt="user testing example 2"></div>
				<div class="textgrid slideanim">
					<p class="content">The second round of user testing feedback resulted in the following: (1)The logo blended into the background, this prompted a color palette change, and a logo redesign seen below in user testing results.<br>
					<br>
					(2)The dropdown menu was still being overlooked, so the individual document functions were spelled out on the individual file.<br>
					<br>
					(3)Users were confused about how FileWeave facilitated advanced organization. Here three different screen views were created, where you can upload files directly to these different realms of your life, to avoid having to organize different files, these overarching umbrella files called "baskets" offer painless organization at your fingertips.<br>
					<br>
					(4)Yet again, users found it confusing that there were two upload buttons, so the button itself was eliminated, and the folder upload icon was created to clearly differentiate and identify the use.</p><br>

			<p class="content">Going through the empathetic process of research and design, I was able to successfully apply user feedback to discover direction for creating an effective solution to the problem at hand. I also began developing a mindful practice of continuously attempting to eliminate my own bias in the design and research process. There were many points in this process where I had to remind myself that I am not designing this product for myself, but for my user. This practice has now become a habit that will be critical to my success as I continue to develop as a UX Designer.<br>
			<br>
			Another big takeaway from this process was that you should always back your usability testing up with more usability testing. Taking the results from an individual user test doesn't necessarily mean that is the best design change for a majority of users. Aggregating results and communicating with the design community will always produce the best results. I made the most strides in my learning when I received the most critical feedback from fellow designers. Keeping my bias in check, listening to my users and design community have helped me design with confidence, knowing that these decisions were not created by my own bias, but by real people that have the problem and know the solution.</p>
