				<h2 class="subtitle">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
				<p class="content">Activo is a project that was created during my time as a Design student with Bloc. I had full creative freedom to execute my design process on this passion project. Activo is an application built for travelers. It solves the problem of not being able to have a culturally immersive experience while traveling, or simply put, "travel like a local." As traveling becomes more accessible and widespread, users expectations for their travel experiences change, and this is a problem that I have identified as a consequence of these changing circumstances. Being a passion project, I had a lot of fun developing this idea into a working prototype. Below you can quickly jump to a section to read more about the different stages of my design process, or scan through the whole thing as you please.</p>

				<p class="content" id="problemcontent">After discovery was completed, the following problem was unveiled:
					<br>
					<br>(1) travelers want a local perspective and experience but don't know any locals
					<br>(2) meeting strangers in a foreign city is difficult, and can be awkward
					<br>
					<br>From this feedback the problem was identified: travelers need a tool to help connect them with locals, that also bridges the gap of uncomfortability in meeting a stranger.

				<h2 class="subtitle">SOLUTION</h2>
				<p class="content">An application that allows travelers to find local people that advertize activities, so that the traveler can get a local experience, while also reducing social uncomfortability of meeting a new person by setting the expectation of sharing an activity together. This solution offers the user an experience that offers the user a better understand local life, and create a meaningful memory and relationship while traveling.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle ">RESEARCH OVERVIEW</h2>
			<p class="content">First off, I deployed a google forms survey through email, slack, reddit, and a community college student forum in Seattle, WA. I had a total of n=49 participants, though a majority of my respondents were international college students.  This skewed the data somewhat, but for the purposes of this case study, there was a solid foundation of feedback to work with.
				<br>
				<br>The initial problem hypothesis I was testing for was this: <strong>"learning language with a person while sharing an activity produces higher rates of comprehension than classroom learning."</strong> Survey responses showed that my hypothesis was confirmed, but the written responses showed that the activity based language meet up application wasn't what these users were looking for.
				<br>
				<br><u><strong>Responses included:</strong></u>
				<br>
				<br>“I would want to do one of those activities, but I would never make a lesson plan centered around an activity. It's boring and tedious to come up with content for practicing language, but if there is an activity/goal involved and no pressure involved, it's easier to interact and I am more motivated to learn the vocabulary and try to speak."
				<br>
				<br>"I don't have enough time to do this regularly"
				<br>
				<br>"Teaching language is boring, I would hang out with someone while learning thought"
				<br>
				<br>"I'd rather just cook together than feel pressured"
				<br>
				<br>"Skipping the language lesson and just hanging out with the person seems better"

He’s also a great cook, so he offers to cook for guests at his apartment in NY. When John travels, he ususally travels alone. He typically takes long backpacking trips around the world, and he likes to get a feel for local flavor. He’s had many bad experiences with awkward meetups abroad, so he thinks meeting someone for an activity sets good pretense for their visit. He’s a curious explorer, always ready for his next adventure.</p>

I researched the following three competitors to understand their strengths, weaknessess, market opportunities and threats so that I could give Activo a unique angle. Here are some of the major takeaways gleaned from the results:</p>

					(1)In Person Usability Testing, (2)Remote Usability Testing, (3)Remote A/B or Preference Testing
					<br>
					<br>I conducted one round of user testing, as well as a preference test. I conducted user tests with four participants, two in person tests and two via Skype. I wrote a user test script which I used with each participant to ensure my tests and results were as consistent and objective as possible. While conducting these tests I focused on how the user executed the tasks, their verbal responses, as well as nonverbal responses in order to gain as much feedback as possible to maximize improvements on my product.

I acknowledge that ideally I would like to recruit more than 24 participants, but for the purpose of this case study I moved forward in making changes based on these results.  I chose to conduct a preference test to test my own assumption that design A was more visually pleasing than design B.

Ideally, this question would be tested in another round of user testing, but due to time constraints, a preference test was administered in order to decide which button placement was most usable.  <strong>Design A was selected, and users stated that having the "save" button would be overlooked if it took place before the search.</strong>

If given more time, I would do a preference test and usability test after every iteration.</p>
