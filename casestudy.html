        <h1 class="section-header">WHAT I LEARNED</h1>
        <p class="content">Going through the empathetic process of research and design, I was able to successfully apply user feedback to discover direction for creating an effective solution to the problem at hand.  Since this was my first big project, I went through major ups, downs and learning curves.  Notabley, I began developing a mindful practice of personal bias elimination in the design and research process. Through multiple rounds of aggregating user data, the importance of testing and re-testing remarkably improved the quality of my work.  From this experience, I have a deep appriciation and understanding of the critical nature of user testing.  Having my work critiqued and tested over and over again was often stressful and disheartening, but now that I’ve grown a thick skin as a designer, I know that critique is the catalyst for growth in my designs.</p>
